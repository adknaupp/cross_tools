# cross_tools
Library of Python classes for conducting genetic crosses (term "library" applied loosely).

Cross tools is an educational tool for the study of concepts encountered in an undergraduate-level genetics class.
Cross tools consists of Python classes which can be used to solve a variety of "problems" like a traditional calculator.
In addition to revealing solutions, the code outputs details relating to the states of the organisms, progenies, and genes involved in the cross(es) at each step.
By examining the details of each step, you can come to understand how the solution was reached.

Examine and run examples.py to see what cross tools can be used for.

Only classes for two-factor crosses are functional.

Python classes for studying the following concepts are currently under construction:
- Three-factor crosses. Functionality will exist for analyzing recombination frequencies and calculating genetic distance.
- Aneuploidy
- Polyploidy
- Improvements to and extensions of the two-factor cross classes
