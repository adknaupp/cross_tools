The transposon is flanked by a pair of 38 base pair inverted repeats. Tn3 normally resides on a bacterial plasmid. Transposition is initiated by the activity of the transposase which fuses a plasmid containing Tn3 to a plasmid that does not have Tn3 to form a cointegrate. The cointegrate is then resolved into two separate plasmids via the action of resolvase, each containing a Tn3 transposon.

The Activator (Ac) element is autonomous, whereas the Dissociator (Ds) element requires an Ac element to transpose. In 1938, Rhoades (Genetics 23:377-397) reported the first known study demonstrating the inheritance patterns associated with autonomous and non-autonomous transposons.  In one experiment, he crossed a yellow-kernel corn plant with pollen from a purple (colored)-kernel corn plant.  The mutation that causes the yellow kernel is the result of a Ds element insertion into an otherwise normal allele of the C1 gene (colored), creating the so-called “c1-m1” allele. A cross is made between a yellow-kernel parent homozygous for the c1-m1 allele and a colored-kernel parent homozygous for the C1 allele, and homozygous at an independent locus for an Ac element. The F1 kernels are all purple.  What is the ratio of colored : spotted : yellow kernels you expect to see in the F2 generation after self-pollinating the F1 plants?

Wild-type, dominant C1 alleles produce a purple color, whereas c1 is a recessive, stable mutant allele that produces a colorless or yellow seed when homozygous. The recessive, mutant c1-m1 allele contains a Ds transposable element, such that it is mutable and may revert back to a wild-type allele in the presence of an active Ac element. Reversion of a c1-m1 allele to wild-type yields a spotted phenotype as long as the second allele at the locus is a mutant allele. A yellow-seeded c1c1 maize plant which lacks an Ac element is crossed with a maize plant with spotted kernels that is homozygous for the mutable c1-m1 allele and an Ac element located 12 cM from c1-m1. The F1 progeny from this cross are then backcrossed to the yellow-seeded parent. What proportion of the backcross progeny seeds will be spotted?
