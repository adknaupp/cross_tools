The female progeny are heterozygous for two inversions. The inversion in chromosome 3 spans 8 cM, so the probability of a crossover within that region is 8%, and the probability of no crossover in that region is 92%. The inversion in the X chromosome spans 14 cM, so the probability of a crossover in that region is 14%, and the probability of no crossover in that region is 86%. The two chromosomes assort independently and any gamete that arises from a crossover in either inversion is unbalanced. Hence the probability of no crossovers in either inversion is 0.92 X 0.86 = 0.791. The proportion of unbalanced gametes can most easily be determined by subtracting the proportion of balanced gametes from unity: 1 - 0.791 = 0.209. \n","\n","# answer is 0.209"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HdO5tvibu-7u"},"source":["## Question 8\n"," If the males and females generated by the cross (F1 generation) are allowed to randomly intermate, what portion of the next generation (F2) females should be heterozygous for both inversions? \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XwcnnF6pvGgW"},"source":["# Viable F1 male gametes that will produce female F2 progeny include 3 X and 3i X, whereas viable F1 female gametes include 3 X, 3 Xi, 3i X and 3i Xi.
